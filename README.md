## Tasks

Given the template code, read through the comments and finish all the empty code. You should see where you need to complete the code has something like # Your code goes here or # START CODING HERE.

Some functions already provided in the codebase you might not understad those so don't worry about that.

You don't need to reimplement the code from files: `non_iid.py`, `cifar10_cnn.py`, `min_lr_step.py`, `utils.py`
